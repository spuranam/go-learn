package main

// An interface can contain the name of one (or more) other interface(s), which
// is equivalent to explicitly enumerating the methods of the embedded interface
// in the containing interface. The effect is  as if we had written the embedded
// interfaceâ€™s method signatures in the interface that embeds it.

// For example the standard library io package defines several interfaces, some
// of them are defined by embedding other interfaces.
